		<p>Most know it as ecstasy or “Molly,” swallowed to alter and heighten our sensations of intense energy, empathy and pleasure. Yet, according to “A MAPS (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) History of MDMA,” since 1986 the United States’ therapy community has been researching MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and working towards it’s legalisation. FDA is now in agreement with MAPS on Phase 3 protocol designs after a rigorous Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process. The association’s goal is to develop MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD into an FDA-approved prescription treatment by the end of 2021.</p>

		<p>There are therapists that are working beyond the limitations of clinical trials and the law, to provide the treatment to individuals that seek it and need it. Here is a glimpse into the story of one woman, who illegally underwent this form of therapy in July 2019, and has since been better for it.</p>

	<p>“I’m going to be very honest and open about it, I’m not ashamed of what I ended up experiencing. It’s quite a shock to be honest, and I had no idea that this happened to me.” “Claire” begins the telling of her experience with a great deal of self awareness and openness. </p>

	<p>The therapist she used is part of the MAPS community, and is a mentee Anne Other, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Surrender-Receive-Release-Trauma/dp/1619617382" target="_blank">“Trust Surrender Receive: How Mdma Can Release Us from Trauma and Ptsd”.</a> The 8-hour therapy session took place after a preliminary skype meeting with the therapist, assessing whether or not “Claire” is recommended to handle the extensive nature of the therapy. Many factors informed her decision to pursue the therapy, such as having lived through a war, being sexually abused at the age of 11 and her mother’s worsening Alzeihmer’s (not listed in order of importance or significance). </p>

	<p>The session began with the first of two dosages, 45 minutes a-part. Within that time frame “Claire” began her trip with fleeting nerves and impatience. She headed into the session with no particular expectations, and in part received an unprecedented experience of recollections. Forgotten childhood incidents of sexual abuse and near-death resurfaced. “One part of what I saw I had no idea I had experienced,” however, the environment and nature of the MDMA enabled a safe and productive space for “Claire” to deal with, and process these specific traumas. The drug incited compassion and self-love, she was able to access and relive the memories exempt of pain and fear. “At the time I didn’t feel traumatised by what I had discovered...I know that in my everyday life, like with my children I’m a control freak. I now understand that it can stem from some of the trauma I experienced; as a child I couldn’t control what was happening to me. Now that I’m aware of what happened to me, with time, therapy, and lifestyle changes I’m able to work through it.” </p>

	<p>Beyond the professionally labelled “reintegration” period, lies the necessary and self-allocated time to fully benefit from the session by processing and dealing with the confounded experience. “I think just doing the session itself, and no work afterwards is completely wasted. It’s about becoming conscious of certain behavioural traits that are a bit extreme, trying to understand why, how, where there stemming from.” “Claire” further elaborated, “I’m working on myself in other ways so that I can integrate all this information. Even now sometimes when I meditate I see my young child self. I think I had this self-hate but now I explain to her it’s okay to love yourself.”</p>

	<p>“When it came to my mother, and my sentiments towards her I actually felt quite at peace.” “Claire” says with a sense of relief and comfort. “I didn’t feel this anger towards her anymore”</p>

	<p>It’s a long term process, in which the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy gave “Claire” the opportunity to expand her self-knowledge and work through her inhibiting tendencies. “I feel more connected to myself.”</p>

	<p>“Maybe regular therapy can achieve the same results as MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, just not in this lifetime.” Aubrey Marcus, on his podcast in discussion with Dr. Michael and Annie Mithoefer.</p>
